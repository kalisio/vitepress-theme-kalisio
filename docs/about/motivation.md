**vitepress-theme-kalisio** is designed to enhance the functionality of [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a static site generator powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). This theme integrates several features to streamline and enhance the development of documentation websites.

This theme is used on our various documentation websites. Although it was developed for internal use, it allows extensive customization. Thus, you can extend or modify it by adding your own components or adjusting existing ones. The theme also supports custom layouts and additional configuration to fit your specific needs.
